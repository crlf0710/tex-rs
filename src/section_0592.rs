//! @* \[32] Shipping pages out.
//! After considering \TeX's eyes and stomach, we come now to the bowels.
//! @^bowels@>
//!
//! The |ship_out| procedure is given a pointer to a box; its mission is
//! to describe that box in \.{DVI} form, outputting a ``page'' to |dvi_file|.
//! The \.{DVI} coordinates $(h,v)=(0,0)$ should correspond to the upper left
//! corner of the box being shipped.
//!
//! Since boxes can be inside of boxes inside of boxes, the main work of
//! |ship_out| is done by two mutually recursive routines, |hlist_out|
//! and |vlist_out|, which traverse the hlists and vlists inside of horizontal
//! and vertical boxes.
//!
//! As individual pages are being processed, we need to accumulate
//! information about the entire set of pages, since such statistics must be
//! reported in the postamble. The global variables |total_pages|, |max_v|,
//! |max_h|, |max_push|, and |last_bop| are used to record this information.
//!
//! The variable |doing_leaders| is |true| while leaders are being output.
//! The variable |dead_cycles| contains the number of times an output routine
//! has been initiated since the last |ship_out|.
//!
//! A few additional global variables are also defined here for use in
//! |vlist_out| and |hlist_out|. They could have been local variables, but
//! that would waste stack space when boxes are deeply nested, since the
//! values of these variables are not needed during recursive calls.
