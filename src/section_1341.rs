//! @ First let's consider the format of whatsit nodes that are used to represent
//! the data associated with \.{\\write} and its relatives. Recall that a whatsit
//! has |type=whatsit_node|, and the |subtype| is supposed to distinguish
//! different kinds of whatsits. Each node occupies two or more words; the
//! exact number is immaterial, as long as it is readily determined from the
//! |subtype| or other data.
//!
//! We shall introduce five |subtype| values here, corresponding to the
//! control sequences \.{\\openout}, \.{\\write}, \.{\\closeout}, \.{\\special}, and
//! \.{\\setlanguage}. The second word of I/O whatsits has a |write_stream| field
//! that identifies the write-stream number (0 to 15, or 16 for out-of-range and
//! positive, or 17 for out-of-range and negative).
//! In the case of \.{\\write} and \.{\\special}, there is also a field that
//! points to the reference count of a token list that should be sent. In the
//! case of \.{\\openout}, we need three words and three auxiliary subfields
//! to hold the string numbers for name, area, and extension.
//
// @d write_node_size=2 {number of words in a write/whatsit node}
// @d open_node_size=3 {number of words in an open/whatsit node}
// @d open_node=0 {|subtype| in whatsits that represent files to \.{\\openout}}
// @d write_node=1 {|subtype| in whatsits that represent things to \.{\\write}}
/// `subtype` in whatsits that represent things to `\write`
pub(crate) const write_node: quarterword = 1;
// @d close_node=2 {|subtype| in whatsits that represent streams to \.{\\closeout}}
/// `subtype` in whatsits that represent streams to `\closeout`
