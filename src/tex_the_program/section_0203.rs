//! @* \[14] Copying boxes.
//! Another recursive operation that acts on boxes is sometimes needed: The
//! procedure |copy_node_list| returns a pointer to another node list that has
//! the same structure and meaning as the original. Note that since glue
//! specifications and token lists have reference counts, we need not make
//! copies of them. Reference counts can never get too large to fit in a
//! halfword, since each pointer to a node is in a different memory address,
//! and the total number of memory addresses fits in a halfword.
//! @^recursion@>
//! @^reference counts@>
//!
//! (Well, there actually are also references from outside |mem|; if the
//! |save_stack| is made arbitrarily large, it would theoretically be possible
//! to break \TeX\ by overflowing a reference count. But who would want to do that?)
