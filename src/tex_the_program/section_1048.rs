//! @ When erroneous situations arise, \TeX\ usually issues an error message
//! specific to the particular error. For example, `\.{\\noalign}' should
//! not appear in any mode, since it is recognized by the |align_peek| routine
//! in all of its legitimate appearances; a special error message is given
//! when `\.{\\noalign}' occurs elsewhere. But sometimes the most appropriate
//! error message is simply that the user is not allowed to do what he or she
//! has attempted. For example, `\.{\\moveleft}' is allowed only in vertical mode,
//! and `\.{\\lower}' only in non-vertical modes.  Such cases are enumerated
//! here and in the other sections referred to under `See also \dots.'
