//! @* \[55] Index.
//! Here is where you can find all uses of each identifier in the program,
//! with underlined entries pointing to where the identifier was defined.
//! If the identifier is only one letter long, however, you get to see only
//! the underlined entries. {\sl All references are to section numbers instead of
//! page numbers.}
//!
//! This index also lists error messages and other aspects of the program
//! that you might want to look up some day. For example, the entry
//! for ``system dependencies'' lists all sections that should receive
//! special attention from people who are installing \TeX\ in a new
//! operating environment. A list of various things that can't happen appears
//! under ``this can't happen''. Approximately 40 sections are listed under
//! ``inner loop''; these account for about 60\pct! of \TeX's running time,
//! exclusive of input and output.
