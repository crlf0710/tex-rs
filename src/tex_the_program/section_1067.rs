//! @ The routine for a |right_brace| character branches into many subcases,

//! types of groups are not supposed to be ended by a right brace; error
//! messages are given in hopes of pinpointing the problem. Most branches
//! of this routine will be filled in later, when we are ready to understand
//! them; meanwhile, we must prepare ourselves to deal with such errors.
