//! @ The state of affairs at any semantic level can be represented by
//! five values:
//!
//! \yskip\hang|mode| is the number representing the semantic mode, as
//! just explained.
//!
//! \yskip\hang|head| is a |pointer| to a list head for the list being built;
//! |link(head)| therefore points to the first element of the list, or
//! to |null| if the list is empty.
//!
//! \yskip\hang|tail| is a |pointer| to the final node of the list being
//! built; thus, |tail=head| if and only if the list is empty.
//!
//! \yskip\hang|prev_graf| is the number of lines of the current paragraph that
//! have already been put into the present vertical list.
//!
//! \yskip\hang|aux| is an auxiliary |memory_word| that gives further information
//! that is needed to characterize the situation.
//!
//! \yskip\noindent
//! In vertical mode, |aux| is also known as |prev_depth|; it is the scaled
//! value representing the depth of the previous box, for use in baseline
//! calculations, or it is |<=-1000|pt if the next box on the vertical list is to
//! be exempt from baseline calculations.  In horizontal mode, |aux| is also
//! known as |space_factor| and |clang|; it holds the current space factor used in
//! spacing calculations, and the current language used for hyphenation.
//! (The value of |clang| is undefined in restricted horizontal mode.)
//! In math mode, |aux| is also known as |incompleat_noad|; if
//! not |null|, it points to a record that represents the numerator of a
//! generalized fraction for which the denominator is currently being formed
//! in the current list.
//!
//! There is also a sixth quantity, |mode_line|, which correlates
//! the semantic nest with the user's input; |mode_line| contains the source
//! line number at which the current level of nesting was entered. The negative
//! of this line number is the |mode_line| at the level of the
//! user's output routine.
//!
//! In horizontal mode, the |prev_graf| field is used for initial language data.
//!
//! The semantic nest is an array called |nest| that holds the |mode|, |head|,
//! |tail|, |prev_graf|, |aux|, and |mode_line| values for all semantic levels
//! below the currently active one. Information about the currently active
//! level is kept in the global quantities |mode|, |head|, |tail|, |prev_graf|,
//! |aux|, and |mode_line|, which live in a \PASCAL\ record that is ready to
//! be pushed onto |nest| if necessary.
