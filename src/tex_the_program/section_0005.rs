//! @ The overall \TeX\ program begins with the heading just shown, after which
//! comes a bunch of procedure declarations and function declarations.
//! Finally we will get to the main program, which begins with the
//! comment `|start_here|'. If you want to skip down to the
//! main program now, you can look up `|start_here|' in the index.
//! But the author suggests that the best way to understand this program
//! is to follow pretty much the order of \TeX's components as they appear in the
//! \.{WEB} description you are now reading, since the present ordering is
//! intended to combine the advantages of the ``bottom up'' and ``top down''
//! approaches to the problem of understanding a somewhat complicated system.
