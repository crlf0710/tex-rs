//! @ We must now face the fact that the battle is not over, even though the
//! {\def\!{\kern-1pt}%
//! hyphens have been found: The process of reconstituting a word can be nontrivial
//! because ligatures might change when a hyphen is present. {\sl The \TeX book\/}
//! discusses the difficulties of the word ``difficult'', and
//! the discretionary material surrounding a
//! hyphen can be considerably more complex than that. Suppose
//! \.{abcdef} is a word in a font for which the only ligatures are \.{b\!c},
//! \.{c\!d}, \.{d\!e}, and \.{e\!f}. If this word permits hyphenation
//! between \.b and \.c, the two patterns with and without hyphenation are
//! $\.a\,\.b\,\.-\,\.{c\!d}\,\.{e\!f}$ and $\.a\,\.{b\!c}\,\.{d\!e}\,\.f$.
//! Thus the insertion of a hyphen might cause effects to ripple arbitrarily
//! far into the rest of the word. A further complication arises if additional
//! hyphens appear together with such rippling, e.g., if the word in the
//! example just given could also be hyphenated between \.c and \.d; \TeX\
//! avoids this by simply ignoring the additional hyphens in such weird cases.}
//!
//! Still further complications arise in the presence of ligatures that do not
//! delete the original characters. When punctuation precedes the word being
//! hyphenated, \TeX's method is not perfect under all possible scenarios,
//! because punctuation marks and letters can propagate information back and forth.
//! For example, suppose the original pre-hyphenation pair
//! \.{*a} changes to \.{*y} via a \.{\?=:} ligature, which changes to \.{xy}
//! via a \.{=:\?} ligature; if $p_{a-1}=\.x$ and $p_a=\.y$, the reconstitution
//! procedure isn't smart enough to obtain \.{xy} again. In such cases the
//! font designer should include a ligature that goes from \.{xa} to \.{xy}.
//!
//! @ The processing is facilitated by a subroutine called |reconstitute|. Given
//! a string of characters $x_j\ldots x_n$, there is a smallest index $m\ge j$
//! such that the ``translation'' of $x_j\ldots x_n$ by ligatures and kerning
//! has the form $y_1\ldots y_t$ followed by the translation of $x_{m+1}\ldots x_n$,
//! where $y_1\ldots y_t$ is some nonempty sequence of character, ligature, and
//! kern nodes. We call $x_j\ldots x_m$ a ``cut prefix'' of $x_j\ldots x_n$.
//! For example, if $x_1x_2x_3=\.{fly}$, and if the font contains `fl' as a
//! ligature and a kern between `fl' and `y', then $m=2$, $t=2$, and $y_1$ will
//! be a ligature node for `fl' followed by an appropriate kern node~$y_2$.
//! In the most common case, $x_j$~forms no ligature with $x_{j+1}$ and we
//! simply have $m=j$, $y_1=x_j$. If $m<n$ we can repeat the procedure on
//! $x_{m+1}\ldots x_n$ until the entire translation has been found.
//!
//! The |reconstitute| function returns the integer $m$ and puts the nodes
//! $y_1\ldots y_t$ into a linked list starting at |link(hold_head)|,
//! getting the input $x_j\ldots x_n$ from the |hu| array. If $x_j=256$,
//! we consider $x_j$ to be an implicit left boundary character; in this
//! case |j| must be strictly less than~|n|. There is a
//! parameter |bchar|, which is either 256 or an implicit right boundary character
//! assumed to be present just following~$x_n$. (The value |hu[n+1]| is never
//! explicitly examined, but the algorithm imagines that |bchar| is there.)
//!
//! If there exists an index |k| in the range $j\le k\le m$ such that |hyf[k]|
//! is odd and such that the result of |reconstitute| would have been different
//! if $x_{k+1}$ had been |hchar|, then |reconstitute| sets |hyphen_passed|
//! to the smallest such~|k|. Otherwise it sets |hyphen_passed| to zero.
//!
//! A special convention is used in the case |j=0|: Then we assume that the
//! translation of |hu[0]| appears in a special list of charnodes starting at
//! |init_list|; moreover, if |init_lig| is |true|, then |hu[0]| will be
//! a ligature character, involving a left boundary if |init_lft| is |true|.
//! This facility is provided for cases when a hyphenated
//! word is preceded by punctuation (like single or double quotes) that might
//! affect the translation of the beginning of the word.
